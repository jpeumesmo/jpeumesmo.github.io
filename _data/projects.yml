    In this project we aim to automatically detect lanes from a video, the algorithm should run in real-time, so it could be used an onboard computer with a camera to assist the driver, for example. In this project, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing"><font color="#333">Digital Image Processing</font></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision"><font color="#333">Computer Vision</font></a> techniques were used. The project used the open-source library for Computer Vision <mark><a href="https://opencv.org/"><font color="white">OpenCV</font></a></mark>.

    This project was part of some lectures I gave for my Master's advisor during my course. The lectures were about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning"><font color="#333">Machine Learning</font></a> in general, in this set of codes, I used the popular Machine Learning framework <mark><a href="https://pytorch.org/"><font color="white">PyTorch</font></a></mark>, also I configure <mark><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard?hl=pt-br"><font color="white">Tensorboard</font></a></mark> to work with the codes, which makes it easier to observe the evolution of the models during train phase. There are codes for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network"><font color="#333">Artificial Neural Networks</font></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network"><font color="#333">Convolutional Neural Networks</font></a>

    In this project, we aim to create a framework based on RGB images to work as an interface between human gestures and a virtual environment. The project detects and tracks human hands, with that information is possible to understand some human gestures and use them to control a virtual environment. In this project, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing"><font color="#333">Digital Image Processing</font></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision"><font color="#333">Computer Vision</font></a> techniques were used.

    In this project, we aim to create a shared market list. We create an hybrid web app, using technologuies as <mark><a href="https://ionicframework.com/"><font color="white">Ionic</font></a></mark> a popular Cross-platform framework for app development and <mark><a href="https://firebase.google.com/?hl=pt-br"><font color="white">Firebase</font></a></mark> a popular real time database with a easy to use API.

    In this project, we create an app using <mark><a href="https://ionicframework.com/"><font color="white">Ionic</font></a></mark> a popular Cross-platform framework for app development. The proposal of the app was to allow people to report lost animals or animals they have seen on the street, this should make easier the process to find a lost animal, or to adopt an abandoned animal. The app allows the user to report information about the animal such as photo, GPS position, date, etc.
