    I am currently finishing my Master's Degree at UFMG. The department of computer science at university is one of the most prestigious department in Latin America. I have developed my skills in Machine Learning and Computer Vision during my master's course, and had the opportunity to work in a research and development project funded by Petrobras, the biggest Brazilian oil company. Also, I contributed to the laboratory infrastructure, working on the maintenance and repair of several workstations, servers, and systems of distributed file systems through the network.

    During my time at UFSJ, I learned most of my general skills in computer science, there I have the opportunity to develop web systems, work on data mining using textual data, have touch with complex networks algorithms, and develop a project of ubiquitous computing.  There, teamwork and working to tight deadlines were needed skills, since we have to deal with several simultaneous deadlines and with different teams. Also, I have made a lot of friends there, friends that I have contact with until nowadays and probably will take them for life.

    Also, I have been part of the academic center, include being a collegiate member represent the students.
